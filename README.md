I've been programming since ~2015  
I am currently working as a C# Backend Dev also dabbling a bit in our frontend (React | TS) at work since beginning of the year  

Please don't bash my code....   
i'm working on improving and relearning from the ground up, so there may be some.. less than ideal code
  
make it work first - performance can come later
